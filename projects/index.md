## About Course Projects

The projects in this course are **industry-oriented** and **hands-on**, designed to provide practical experience with real-world applications of autonomous mobile robots. Students will work on projects that involve:

- Real-world problem solving
- Industry-standard tools and methodologies
- Hands-on implementation and testing
- Integration of theoretical concepts with practical applications

Project details, requirements, and submission guidelines will be posted here once finalized.
